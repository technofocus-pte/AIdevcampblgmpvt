# Lab 1 - Build and enhance a Safe Travels agent and implement Multi agent orchestration

**Objective**

**Agent templates** are designed to help you get started with a **custom
agent**. You are responsible for assessing all safety and legal
implications of using an agent template and customizing it as
appropriate for your business.

An agent built from the **Safe Travels agent template** is a
Business-to-Employee (B2E) agent designed to provide employees of a
company with **travel assistance**. This agent helps ensure employees
are well-prepared and informed for their next work trip. This agent uses
natural language processing to offer a conversational interface, making
it easy and intuitive for employees to access the information they need.
However, the default website used by the agent currently only covers US
travel destinations. You can replace the default website with your own
knowledge source.

You will then understand how that agent can be enhanced to suit the
needs of specific customers.

In the process of doing that, you will learn the concepts of Agent Flow
creation and Multi agent orchestration in Copilot Studio.

## Exercise 1: Create Safe Travels agent from template

In this exercise, you will create the agent in Copilot Studio using the
Safe Travels agent template.

1.  From a browser, login to
    +++[https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com+++](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com+++/).
    The Start free trial page opens up. Select your country and
    click **Start free trial**.

## Exercise 10 - Implement Multi agent orchestration in Copilot Studio

Rather than relying on a single agent to do everything—or managing
disconnected agents in silos—organizations can now build multi-agent
systems in Copilot Studio (preview), where agents delegate tasks to one
another. This includes those built with the Microsoft 365 agent builder,
Microsoft Azure AI Agents Service, and Microsoft Fabric. These agents
can now all work together to achieve a shared goal: completing complex,
business-critical tasks that span systems, teams, and workflows.

In this exercise, we will add the Leave management agent to the Safe
Travels agent which can be used to learn about the leaves when planning
to travel.

1.  Select the **Safe Travels** agent from Copilot Studio.

![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
incorrect.](./media/image107.png)

2.  We will first test this agent to see what information it can give on
    leaves. From the Test pane, enter +++Check Leave balance+++ and hit
    enter.

![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
incorrect.](./media/image108.png)

3.  You can see that the agent responds with a generalized information
    on how to check the leave balance. It also refers to the Travel
    Policy document while doing this.

![A screenshot of a phone AI-generated content may be
incorrect.](./media/image109.png)

4.  Select the **Agents** tab from the top menu and select **+ Add**.

![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be

    select **Copilot Studio**.

![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
incorrect.](./media/image111.png)

6.  From the list, select **Leave Manager Agent**. It can be added only
    if it is published. Please wait if it is in the process of
    publishing.

![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
incorrect.](./media/image112.png)

7.  Select **Add agent** to add this agent to **Safe Travels**.
